# landsimR

The goal of landsimR is to allow simple yet ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of landsimR like so:

``` r
install_github('m-kucera/landsimR')
```

## Basic Virtual Landscape Creation


```{r example}
library(landsimR)
landscape = create_landscape(c(100, 100), c(.1, .1, .1), c(.3, .3, .3))
```


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

Plot of `landscape`:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(terra)
plot(rast(landscape))
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
